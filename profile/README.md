## **School Pedagogy Assessment Research and Text Analytics (SPARTA) Research Group**

<span class="p">We are a newly formed research group in IDP in Educational Technology, IIT Bombay started in May 2022\. Our research focuses on human-centered Artificial Intelligence that enhances human capabilities, understands and anticipates an individual’s needs, especially with context to learning. We work with researchers from different disciplines (e.g. Learning Analytics, Information Retrieval) to build quality educational products that help learners to succeed in their quest for learning. The logo symbolizes '[Infinite Syntropy](https://philosophy-of-science.com/defining-syntropy/)'- reflecting a research journey (the continuous transformation from chaos to a well defined structure).</span><span class="p"><u>**Broad Research Area:**</u></span><span class="p">**Cognitively informed Artificial Intelligence for Learning Optimization**</span><span class="p">_Analyzing insights from human perception of information from text data (e.g. how people learn, remember, and make decisions based on textual information) into the design and development of intelligent tools to support learning._</span><span class="p">Confereneces where our research got accepted: [ACM Intelligent User Interfaces](https://iui.acm.org/2023/), [Educational Data Mining](https://educationaldatamining.org/edm2023/), [Artificial Intelligence in Education](https://www.aied2023.org/index.html).</span>

Be **battle ready**. The moment you go out be ready to face anything and everything the world may throw at you today, both good and bad.  

If you found an interesting problem and haven't started solving it, be ready to read about it's solution in your next literature survey.  

We want to be a “people first” research group that focuses on both the academic and personal growth of the members.  

We do not expect you to know everything. We expect that you are trying to know.  

We celebrate effort. We believe in giving effort till randomness favors us.  

Discussions are always open and encouraged. And it can be beyond your current research topic. We talk, brainstorm, and sprint a lot. Our whiteboards are always full.  

We expect ideas from you. No matter how small or ambitious it is. Tell us. We will hear you.  

Lastly, it’s OK to have a bad day. There is always a tomorrow.</span>

    (UG Intern from IISER Pune, June-July ‘22)

</div>

<span class="p">_Anirban and Nandagopal worked on a comparative study using Bloom’s Taxonomy to evaluate the cognitive levels of secondary school STEM exam questions in Indian School Boards. This research study investigates the cognitive levels of the questions used for assessment and evaluation purposes in three national school board secondary school leaving examinations in STEM subjects, administered in Indian schools from 2011 to 2020\. We used the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy to identify the cognitive levels of 3071 exam questions. The study addresses the gap in the current literature on the non-availability of a comparative study of national school board assessment practices in India. The study provides a comparative analysis of three English medium Indian school boards (ICSE, CBSE, and NIOS) by analyzing what areas/topics the board exams test and which ones they ignore. Based on this analysis we were able to identify trends present in boards/subjects in the 10th standard national level exams in India. This study will help school education stakeholders to get an insight into the cognitive level trend/patterns of assessment questions.  
(preprint and dataset will be available soon). Anirban and Nandagopal are in 4th and 3rd year of a 5 year BS-MS program respectively._</span><span class="p">
