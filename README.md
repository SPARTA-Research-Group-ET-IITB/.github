We are a newly formed research group in IDP in Educational Technology, IIT Bombay started in May 2022. Our research focuses on human-centered Artificial Intelligence that enhances human capabilities, understands and anticipates an individualâ€™s needs, especially with context to learning. We work with researchers from different disciplines (e.g. Learning Analytics, Information Retrieval) to build quality educational products that help learners to succeed in their quest for learning. The logo symbolizes 'Syntropy'.

Broad Research Area:

Cognitively informed Artificial Intelligence for Learning Optimization Analyzing insights from human perception of information from text data (e.g. how people learn, remember, and make decisions based on textual information) into the design and development of intelligent tools to support learning.
