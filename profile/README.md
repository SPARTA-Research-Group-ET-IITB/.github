School Pedagogy Assessment Research and Text Analytics (SPARTA) Research Group
We are a newly formed research group in IDP in Educational Technology, IIT Bombay started in May 2022. Our research focuses on human-centered Artificial Intelligence that enhances human capabilities, understands and anticipates an individual’s needs, especially with context to learning. We work with researchers from different disciplines (e.g. Learning Analytics, Information Retrieval) to build quality educational products that help learners to succeed in their quest for learning. The logo symbolizes 'Infinite Syntropy'- reflecting a research journey (the continuous transformation from chaos to a well defined structure).Broad Research Area:Cognitively informed Artificial Intelligence for Learning OptimizationAnalyzing insights from human perception of information from text data (e.g. how people learn, remember, and make decisions based on textual information) into the design and development of intelligent tools to support learning.Confereneces where our research got accepted: ACM Intelligent User Interfaces, Educational Data Mining, Artificial Intelligence in Education.

Our Research Projects
Long-term Research Projects: (Ideally for Ph.D. candidates)Better Textbook Initiative: This is a comprehensive project to improve and optimize learner experience while interacting with a textbook. Currently project is sub-divided into three major goals:

1. Designing an 'phygital' interactive intelligent platform to combine digital advantages of interactions in physical textbooks.

2. Creating cognitively informed questions based on user interaction with learning materials (textbooks).

3. Developing an AI based support for the learner while interacting with the 'phygital' intelligent interactive platform.The current projects are:

Designing an immersive collaborative active learning experience through Phygital textbooks
[Project domain: Smart textbooks, Phygital textbooks]

Identifying learner deficiency in conceptual understanding while answering questions
[Project domain: Question answer generation from restricted and limited search space]

Designing and developing a supportive intelligent conversational tool using learner-interaction data
[Project domain: Conversational Artificial Intelligence]

Short-term Research Projects:

Analyzing visitor traffic for the ET-IITB website using a heatmap

Educational Text translation: A Cognitive Informativity-based approach (IIT Bombay iSURP)

Design and Development of a No-code AI Tech Stack for instructional design

Collaboration Projects

Cognitive level Analysis of tenth standard board examination assessment questions for STEM subjects in India — June 2022 - July 2022.
Project domain: School Education, Assessment. Summer Research Project with IISER Pune

Sponsored Projects

Design and development of low-cost immersive technology enabled inclusive and accessible OER (open educational resources) textbooks — June 2022 - present.
Project domain: Smart textbooks. Sponsor: IRCC, IIT Bombay

Our Group Ethos
We want to be a “people first” research group that focuses on both the academic and personal growth of the members.

We do not expect you to know everything. We expect that you are trying to know.

We celebrate effort. We believe in giving effort till randomness favors us.

Discussions are always open and encouraged. And it can be beyond your current research topic. We talk, brainstorm, and sprint a lot. Our whiteboards are always full.

We expect ideas from you. No matter how small or ambitious it is. Tell us. We will hear you.

Lastly, it’s OK to have a bad day. There is always a tomorrow.

Alumni

Anirban Roy Chowdhury and Nandagopal KS
(UG Intern from IISER Pune, June-July ‘22)

Anirban and Nandagopal worked on a comparative study using Bloom’s Taxonomy to evaluate the cognitive levels of secondary school STEM exam questions in Indian School Boards. This research study investigates the cognitive levels of the questions used for assessment and evaluation purposes in three national school board secondary school leaving examinations in STEM subjects, administered in Indian schools from 2011 to 2020. We used the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy to identify the cognitive levels of 3071 exam questions. The study addresses the gap in the current literature on the non-availability of a comparative study of national school board assessment practices in India. The study provides a comparative analysis of three English medium Indian school boards (ICSE, CBSE, and NIOS) by analyzing what areas/topics the board exams test and which ones they ignore. Based on this analysis we were able to identify trends present in boards/subjects in the 10th standard national level exams in India. This study will help school education stakeholders to get an insight into the cognitive level trend/patterns of assessment questions.
(preprint and dataset will be available soon). Anirban and Nandagopal are in 4th and 3rd year of a 5 year BS-MS program respectively.
Publications: Vijay augmented their Summer project work and it was accepted as a poster in EDM 2023. Congrats Anirban and Nandagopal!

Our Outreach Program

Project STORIES (Structured Tutorials and Organized Resources for Independent Extensive Studies)

Project STORIES is all about the supporting the journey of the 'last mile learner'. Project STORIES was formed with the idea of providing world-class learning opportunities at no cost to anyone working to improve their lives. This project currently curates a generic curriculum and study timetable for popular topics mostly related to undergraduate STEM students interested in technical research roles in the future. The students can utilize the proposed curriculum and study timetable for each course and can use the reference content for independent study. The generic curriculum contains free and publicly available content which allows the learners to understand the concepts, learn the tools, and get skilled to embark on their journey.

Disclaimer: Project STORIES doesn't collect any financial support through any means. It's a pro bono personal social responsibility initiative.

Open Resources:Books:
Design for Learning - A brief introduction to instructional text.
Doing Research: A New Researcher’s Guide - Describes how to conceptualize, conduct, and communicate research in education. Focuses on developing a conceptual understanding of the research process. Informs beginning and early-career researchers about the importance of performing solid, legitimate research.
Theoretical and Practical Advances in Computer-based Educational Measurement - Presents theoretical and practical innovations in educational measurement. Builds upon earlier findings and brings some of the latest developments in several important fields. A state of the art work written by experiences authors. Introduces a variety of both psychometrical and educational data mining approaches.
